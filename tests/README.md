# Tests

Tests can be run by executing the `test.sh` script in the root directory, which will execute all the test files ending in `_test.py` in this directory. 

Currently, only a simple integration test is implemented. As we continue to develop this package, we should aim to expand the testing suite to encompass as much functionality as possible. This should be relatively straightforwad now with the testing environment set up.
