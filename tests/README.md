# Tests

Tests can be run by executing the `test.sh` script, assuming you're running in a unix-like environment. This creates a virtual environment, builds the package and install all its dependencies, and then executes all the test files ending in `_test.py` in this directory. 

Currently, only a simple integration test is implemented. As we continue to develop this package, we should aim to expand the testing suite to encompass as much functionality as possible. This should be relatively straightforwad now with the testing environment set up.
